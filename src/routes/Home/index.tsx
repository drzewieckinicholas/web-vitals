          Web Vitals is an initiative by Google to provide unified guidance for
          quality signals that are essential to delivering a great user
          experience on the web.
        </p>
        <p>
          Google has provided a number of tools over the years to measure and
          report on performance. Some developers are experts at using these
          tools, while others have found the abundance of both tools and metrics
          challenging to keep up with.
        </p>
        <p>
          Site owners should not have to be performance experts to understand
          the quality of experience they are delivering to their users. The Web
          Vitals initiative aims to simplify the landscape, and help sites focus
          on the metrics that matter most, the Core Web Vitals.
